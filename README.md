![image](https://github.com/shinkuan/RandomStuff/assets/35415788/6b66a48b-48fe-4e12-b3cc-18b582410f9a)

You can see that there are two flows here, usually the top one is the "Lobby" websocket flow, and the bottom one is the "Game" websocket flow which appears after you join a match.

Click on the bottom flow to start. (It can take a while, click once and wait, don't click it for multiple times)

### Flow Screen

![image](https://github.com/shinkuan/RandomStuff/assets/35415788/17ae8275-4499-4788-a91b-ecafbac33512)

After you are in the Flow Screen, this is what you should see.
On top left is the LiqiProto Message we captured using MITM.
The LiqiProto Message is then transcribe to mjai format and send to the bot(AI).

On top right is the MJAI Messages, this is the message our bot sent back to us, indicating the action we should do.

Then below is our tehai, it is composed using unicode characters.

Bottom left is the settings.

Bottom right is the bot's action.

# How to keep your account safe

Following guide can minimum the probility of account suspension.

1. Don't use steam, use web instead.
2. Use `safe_code.js` from [Majsoul Mod Plus](https://github.com/Avenshy/majsoul_mod_plus)
3. Don't use MajsoulUnlocker as it modifies websocket.
4. Don't use autoplay, play it yourself.
5. Try to use stickers often.
6. Don't completely follow what bot told you to do.
7. Don't play 24hr a day using autoplay.

### There is no way to guarantee 100% no account suspension currently.

# TODO

- [x] 3 Player Mahjong
  - Already done, but not planned to release yet.
- [x] Change Setting inside application.
- [x] Autoplay
  - [ ] Auto use stickers to make opponent think we are not a bot.
  - [ ] Add random time in settings.json to let user choose time they want.
- [ ] Mix multiple AI's decision to make we more like a human but not a perfect bot.
